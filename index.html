          <p>
            I'm a journalist turned full-stack freelance web developer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Check out some of the apps I've built on my portfolio page. I'm
            proficient in JavaScript and JS frameworks including React and
            jQuery. I've used CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Bulma and Materialize in my
            front-end work. On the back end, I'm proficient with Node.js, mySQL,
            MongoDB, Express, Firebase and Handlebars. I learn fast and work
            well on teams.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a journalist, I was dedicated to making information engaging and easy to understand. I started out copy editing and
            designing newspaper pages, where I developed design chops and a sharp eye for errors. I later spent more than four years
            engaging readers on social media and working to increase web traffic at Maine's largest newspaper. Using engagement
            data, I created a strategy that increased our Facebook following from 21,000 to 120,000 in my time there.

          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As a web developer, I create intuitive products
            that meet users where they are.
