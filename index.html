                <p>A journalist turned full-stack developer seeking opportunities to engineer useful and intuitive
                    online experiences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Check out apps I've built so far on my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>. I'm proficient
                    in JavaScript and JS frameworks including React and jQuery. I've used CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma and
                    Materialize in my front-end work. On the back end, I'm proficient with Node.js, mySQL, MongoDB,
                    Express, Firebase and Handlebars. I learn fast and work well on teams.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a journalist, I was dedicated to making information engaging and easy to understand. I started
                    out copy editing and designing newspaper pages, where I developed design chops and a sharp eye for
                    errors. I later spent more than four years engaging readers on social media and working to increase
                    web traffic at Maine's largest newspaper. Using engagement data, I created an engagement strategy
                    that increased our Facebook following from 21,000 to 120,000 in my time there.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As a web developer, I want to create fast, smart, intuitive products that meet users where they are.
